title: "New website"

After several years of it sitting on a rather long to-do list, I've finally set up a website and blog! I'm going to keep it mostly linguistics-based, as that's what I do, but little bits of tech and general hobbies will certainly sneak in when I'm not looking.

I was originally going to go with a Wordpress install but it was suggested that I give [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator, a try instead. Considering I didn't need the overhead or most of the features of a CMS like Wordpress, have done some HTML and a tiny amount of CSS (albeit it over ten years ago), and like working locally from a text editor, it seemed like a good idea. The ability to host the site for free on GithubPages was also appealing, especially since I'm now using a GitHub repo for my thesis as well.

Even with that, I'm definitely not going to deny there was a learning curve. An issue with an incompatible version of Ruby while trying to install the Jekyll Gem ruined what should have been a simple install. Things on the site still aren't quite perfect as I'm still working on resurrecting/resuscitating my HTML and CSS knowledge. I needed to learn Markdown (well, Kramdown, as it happens). I also wanted to learn ```git```, which took a little bit of time (but means I can finally version control my thesis, so it has much greater benefits).

All in all, though, I'm happy with the decision.


<!-- Now, admittedly there is a not-insignificant learning curve if you've never done any web development before as the whole experience benefits hugely from some knowledge of HTML and CSS. Likewise if you're using GithubPages to host the site it's beneficial to learn ```git```. I even ran into an annoying issue with an incompatible version of Ruby  that took some time to resolve. -->

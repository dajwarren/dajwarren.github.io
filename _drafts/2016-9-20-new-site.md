I've finally set up a shiny website and blog, and it only took several years to get round to.

[Insert invite to blogwarming party here]

Most posts here will probably be on something related to linguistics. I can't promise everything will be accessible to non-linguists, but I'll do my best to keep the majority at least somewhat understandable. Little bits of tech and general hobbies will also certainly sneak in when I'm not looking. They're rude like that.

### Web 1.0?
Wordpress is relatively straightforward to set up and isn't unfamiliar to me. This site, however, isn't made with Wordpress: it's made with Jekyll, a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator.



My original plan for this site was to go with a conventional wordpress install. Very easy to set up and not altogether unfamiliar to me. In the end, however, I didn't do that: I was persuaded to try [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator, instead. It made sense---considering the majority of the site was going to be static blog posts and pages, I simply didn't need the overhead or the majority of features of a CMS like Wordpress.

I'm definitely not going to deny that there was a bit of a learning curve (though that isn't a bad thing!). Wordpress would have initially been quicker and easier---while Jekyll should, in theory, have been simple to install, an issue with an incompatible older version of Ruby when installing the Jekyll Gem put an end to that. I also wanted to add a menu to the site layout I'm using, but that ended with me having to rewrite most of the layout HTML files to allow it. Thankfully I'd done some HTML and CSS before, but that was ten years ago, so I really had to work to resurrect/resuscitate my skills. Finally, I also had to learn ```git``` for the ease of being able to version control the site and push changes to the live version in the Github repo.

All in all, though, I'm happy with the decision. Jekyll does fit my needs well. Typing posts in Markdown from a text editor is almost effortless and fits into my workflow well. Having had to learn ```git``` means that I'm now using it for my thesis, which should (fingers crossed!) make the editing and rewriting much easier.

There is still a lot to do in terms of how the site looks, but that shouldn't be difficult. The main challenge now will be keeping the blog alive. I've never been good at regular posting.

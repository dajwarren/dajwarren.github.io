## Sounds, not letters
This might be difficult, but I want you to pretend to forget everything you know about spelling because it's irrelevant to what we're about to do. Instead, I want you to focus instead on how words sound and on the movement of your mouth and tongue as you speak. Ready? Then let's begin!

## Consonants
So what's a consonant?--and remember, no references to letters!

## Duration
Time is one of the fundamental elements of a sound wave, which of course includes speech. As with notes in music, different parts of speech can last for different lengths of time. My current research looks at vowel sounds and how their duration changes based on what sound comes after them.

<h5>Vowels</h5>
While English spelling has five/six vowel letters (a, e, i, o, u (y)), spoken English has many more vowel sounds.

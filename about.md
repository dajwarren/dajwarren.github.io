## David A. J. Warren
I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Aberdeen. I specialise in in sociophonetics -- the study of socially-structured variation in the sound patterns of speech.
<!-- My current research looks at vowel timing in the North East of Scotland, focussing predominantly on the Scottish Vowel Length Rule. -->

Here's a collection of software etc that I've found useful at some point or another. Everything listed here is free because I like free things.

## Linguistics software
**[Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/):** Arguably one of the most widely used programs for acoustic analysis in phonetics.

**[FAVE](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE):** Forced Alignment and Vowel Extraction. When passed audio and a transcription, the FAVE-align returns a fully segmented Praat TextGrid. FAVE-extract, well, extracts measurements from an appropriately-segmented TextGrid and returns a delimted text file. Will probably get a blog post at some point.

## Audio software
**[SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net):** Command line tool for audio playback and manipulation. It's my go-to for splitting channels and downsampling.

## Keyboard layouts
#### Local
**[UCL IPA keyboard](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/phonetics/):** This is the keyboard layout for the IPA that I found the most intuitive. Unfortunately it's only for Windows and doesn't have the full IPA. I've made a version for Ubuntu that fixes both of these problems.

#### Web-based
**[Chomskey](http://sci1.uk/Chomskey/#ucl-ipa):** This is what was made for me when I complained too much about having to use slow and unfamiliar IPA keyboard websites when away from my own computer. Just get typing.

## Text editors
**[Atom](https://atom.io/):** Currently my favourite text editor. It's what I write my thesis in, manage my website with, and many other things. It's hugely customisable via plugins (and you can make your own). It will also probably get a blog post.

**[Vim](http://www.vim.org/):** An incredibly powerful editor, though doesn't exactly score highly on immediate user-friendliness. One day I will learn it properly.

## IDEs
**[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/):** IDE for R. It might make your life a lot easier.

**[Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/):** Okay, so it's technically a LaTeX editor, but close enough. Before discovering Atom it was my preferred editor and the ability to compile from the GUI is useful even if you're not using most of the other features. It's also cross-platform.

## Useful links
**[Stardew wiki](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki)**: has information on everything.

**[Upload Farm](http://upload.farm):** It's where I uploaded my farm.

## Mods
Several of these require the installation of [SMAPI](https://github.com/cjsu/SMAPI/releases). Download the .zip and extract it into the folder the game's installed in (possibly ```C:/ProgramFiles/Steam/steamapps/common/StardewValley```, depending on how things are set up).


**[Lookup Anything](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541/?):** hover the cursor over things and press F1 to get a wiki-like information panel about that thing. You can also get info on characters from their birthdays on the calendar.

**[Chest labels](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/242/):** adds the ability to give chests labels that pop up when you hover over them. You'll need to install it, then download [the update](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/smapi-entos-home-of-abandoned-mods.125031/) (it's at the bottom of the post) and extract it to the same folder, overwriting things as needed. Then to use it you'll need to click the button on the chest interface to hide the colours as the text box appears under them...


## Suggestions

### Tools
- Collect your copper axe from the blacksmith if you haven't already.
- Upgrade your [pickaxe to copper](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Copper_Pickaxe), as it'll make the mines easier.
- Once you get more iron from the mines, consider upgrading both tools from copper to iron (5 bars per tool, so 25 iron ore each).

<div class="info">
<h5>Secret Woods</h5>
Once you get the iron axe, you can get access to the <a href="http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods">secret woods</a>. You can get 12 hardwood a day from the treestumps there, which you'll need for a <a href="http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stable">stable</a>.
</div>

### Mines
- Take food. I got by with the [field snacks](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Field_Snack), but they don't restore much health. [Survival burgers](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Survival_Burger) might be an option, though you'd have to buy the flour until you get a [mill](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mill) built. You might also want to consider [sashimi](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sashimi), but you'd need to get the recipe from [Linus](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Linus) first and the health restoration isn't great. It's cheap, though, at just one fish each!
- Take it five floors at a time. If your health/energy look poor, leave. Dying is expensive.
- Slimes have a small animation before leaping forward. Step out of the way when they do and they'll miss you completely.
- Try to time attacks rather than swinging wildly, especially with slower weapons like the hammer.

<div class="info">
<h5>Minecarts</h5>
Try to prioritise finishing the Boiler Room community centre bundles so you can use the minecart at the bus stop to go straight to the mines. It'll save a lot of time. Everything can be found in the mine, so just keep going down.

### Money
<div class="info">
<h5>Artisan Goods</h5>
<a href="http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artisan_Goods">Artisan goods</a> are an excellent source of income. While there are plenty of other ways to make money, I've been pretty much relying on them.
</div>
- Make [preserves jars](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Preserves_Jar) for jam and pickles. I currently have 11. Some people have loads, but I think it makes things too easy and I don't really need large amounts of money.
- Build three [tappers](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artisan_Goods#Tapper), one for [maple](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Maple_Tree), one for [oak](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Tree), and one for [pine](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pine_Tree). Always keep several of each type of liquid.
- Use the Pine Tar from the tapper to make [kegs](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artisan_Goods#Keg). Pale Ale, from Hops, is a quick source of money, but hops can only be grown in the summer. I ran out of hops, so I'm currently making Beer from Wheat and Wine from Cranberries. Really, though, anything will do.
- Cheese. Cut down the stumps on the farm to get enough hardwood for a [cheese press](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artisan_Goods#Cheese_Press) for your milk.

### Farm crafting
- Sprinklers, sprinklers, sprinklers. Ignore the [basic sprinkler](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sprinkler) as it's basically useless. Focus on the [quality sprinklers](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Quality_Sprinkler), once you get gold from the mines, then slowly on [iridium sprinklers](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iridium_Sprinkler) once you finally start finding more iridium (it's a nightmare...).
- [Lightning Rods](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Lightning_Rod). Lightning can destroy small parts of your farm, and you don't want that. They're also the only source of batteries, which you'll need for several things (including that mysterious wall panel in the bus tunnel!).
<div class="info">
<h5>Storms</h5>
As far as I can tell, lightning seems to only happen during the summer. Try to make sure you have four or so lightning rods built by then, otherwise you'll have to wait another year for batteries.

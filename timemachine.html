    Hello!!

    This is the personal and academic homepage of a PhD student in /lɪŋˈgwɪstɪks/ (that's 'linguistics' in the International Phonetic Alphabet). I specialise in phonetics and sociolinguistics. That means I focus on the sounds of speech and how we make and perceive them, and how that relates to social and demographic factors like a person's age, where they live, or maybe even how they view their own identity. I also like to study how these things change across time.
    <br>
    I haven't finished this site, but you can explore it in the meantime. I don't have a guestbook or many snazzy gifs yet, but rest assured that's all coming. I love modern-looking websites, so hopefully I can do something nice here, too!<br>

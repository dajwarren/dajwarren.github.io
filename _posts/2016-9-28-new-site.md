After having it sit on a to-do list for ages, I've finally set up a shiny new website!

[Insert invite to sitewarming party here]

Most posts here will probably be on something related to linguistics. I can't promise everything will be accessible to non-linguists, but I'll do my best to keep the majority at least somewhat understandable. Little bits of tech and general hobbies will also certainly sneak in when I'm not looking. They're rude like that.

### Web 1.0?
The last time I really did much in the way of web development (for my own site only, thankfully!) was back in the mid-2000s, when HTML tables and frames were a thing and CSS wasn't seeing much use amongst those of us who were many miles away from being professionals. It was a dark time in which the unstoppable army of unneccesary 'under construction' [images](http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction/) ruled the web.

That's really no longer the way of things (although you can revisit the wonders/horrors of GeoCities [here](http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/)). When I was going to set up this site, I was going to go with a Wordpress install. I've used it a bit before, and I know it's fairly straightforward to set up and use. In the end, however, I didn't do that: I was persuaded to try [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator, instead. Considering my plans involved static blog posts and I could probably dredge up my HTML knowledge from years prior, it made sense. I really didn't need the overhead of Wordpress. Most of it would have sat unused, taking up space.

I cannot deny, though, that Wordpress would have been easier, maybe more user-friendly, at least at the outset. The Jekyll Gem took exception to my outdated version of Ruby, which dug in its heels and refused to allow itself to be updated. Once I finally resolved that, my attempts to modify the site layout template I'm using to add a sidebar for navigation---which should have been easy---ended with me having to rewrite most of the code of the site, picking up CSS along the way. That took a while. I also had to learn ```git```, but that's been so fantastically useful if anything it's an upside to using Jekyll more than anything else.

All in all, though, it was a great decision. Jekyll fits my needs, now that the creases are mostly ironed out. I can do everything from a text editor, with version control, and push changes when they're done. Jekyll even has a nice shiny local server for previewing development as you work.

The main challenge now will be keeping the blog alive, as I've never been good at regular posting. There are also still little bits and pieces to do here and there to make things look nicer. Hmm, I guess you might even say that the site is still...

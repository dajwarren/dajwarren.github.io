I've finally managed to get round to creating a website/blog/thing. Most posts will probably be related to data in some way, but there'll be some photos and other things sneaking in from time to time. If you can't tell, I have no real plan.

### Web 1.0 (partly) revisited
The last time I really did anything in the way of web design was back in the mid-2000s when HTML tables and frames were a big thing and CSS wasn't seeing much use except by professionals (when not using Flash...). It was perhaps a bit of a dark time in some respects, in which the web was still deluged in unnecessary 'under construction' [images](http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction/).

That was a long time ago now and things have changed. When I was originally going to create this site, I, like so many others, was just going to use WordPress. Then I was introduced to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator, and, well, you're looking at the result. There were a few teething issues with the installation of the Jekyll gem (incompatible versions of Ruby that absolutely did not want to be updated), but other than that it's been pretty great.

The main challenge now will be keeping the blog alive, as I've unfortunately never been good at regular posting. There are also still bits and pieces in the design that need to be fixed, as I ended up doing pretty much all the HTML and CSS myself and it's not quite right everywhere yet. Hmm, I guess you might even say that the site is still...
